# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: Parameters serve as place holders, until we call the function that takes the arguments value and substitute whats written in the parameter. 

Researched answer: Note the difference between parameters and arguments: Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to the function. Parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied.

Your answer: .map transforms the elements in an array, while .filter selects specific elements from an array.
